- Bug fixes -

  * *Issue* *28*: _polyA tails intermediary to transcript sequence_<br>http://code.google.com/p/fluxcapacitor/issues/detail?id=28

  * *Issue* *29*: _Simulator cannot handle identical transcript IDs_<br>http://code.google.com/p/fluxcapacitor/issues/detail?id=29

= Enhancements =

  * _Limited poly-A tail length_: length distribution is cut at maximum known adenylation polymer. This is a temporary solution, the fragmentation initiation step may become slower.
